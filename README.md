## Introduction

The Head Start program promotes school readiness for children under 5 years old from low-income families. HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF)’s Office of Head Start (OHS) oversees grant funding to local agencies providing Head Start services. OHS’s federal oversight responsibilities require significant grants management and a robust system of Training and Technical Assistance (TTA), designed to strengthen grantee performance in accordance with federal standards so every enrolled child is prepared for success in school. However, TTA data collection is fragmented, and data is housed in 27 disconnected platforms, including a limited and unscalable legacy system.

OHS is engaging 18F to help OHS procure a centralized system for relevant TTA data, to track and analyze their work through a combined Path Analysis and Experimentation and Iteration approach, with the potential to also execute an assisted acquisition (this RFQ effort). OHS is engaging 18F to help them identify and define the scope of the procurement for a new, modular TTA platform.

For more insights into the prototyping work 18F is doing as we help set the groundwork for a vendor to take on this work, see our [project repository](https://github.com/18F/Head-Start-TTA). For more information on why we prototype prior to procurement, [our Forest Service team wrote up the importance of discovery research](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/06/22/why-discovery-research-matters-for-modular-procurement/) and we've also written up a blog about why it's [generally a good practice.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/01/30/getting-prepared-to-prototype/)
